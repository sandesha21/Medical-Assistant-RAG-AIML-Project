        "1. **Comprehensive and Medically Appropriate Responses**\n",
        "   The Mistral 7B model ademonstrates the ability to deliver detailed answers that align with established medical knowledge. It addresses core aspects of the question, often incorporating relevant clinical terminology and procedural steps.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Structured Output Format**\n",
        "   The model organizes responses using numbered or bulleted formats, making the information easier to interpret. This structured presentation supports clarity and improves usability, particularly in medical environments where step-by-step protocols are critical.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Contextual Accuracy and Relevance**\n",
        "   Mistral 7B is able to understand the medical intent behind user queries and generates answers that are contextually relevant. It handles multi-part questions by addressing each subcomponent effectively.\n",

        "\n",
        "#### ⚠️ Limitations\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Truncated or Incomplete Answers**\n",
        "   Several responses are cut off mid-sentence, particularly in longer outputs (e.g., responses about traumatic brain injury and fractures). This likely results from token limit constraints and can compromise the completeness and usability of medical advice.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Overly Generic Responses in Some Cases**\n",
        "   Although structurally sound, some answers lack depth and specificity. For instance, treatment protocols may be described in broad terms without tailored context, limiting their applicability to real-world clinical scenarios.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Lack of Contextual Depth for Specialized Scenarios**\n",
        "   The model tends to generalize content rather than deliver nuanced or case-specific guidance. In critical care, where clinical nuance matters, this can reduce the practical value of the information provided.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Conclusion and Next Steps**\n",

        "To overcome these limitations, we will apply **prompt engineering techniques** to guide the model toward producing:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Longer and more complete outputs (adjusting `max_tokens`)\n",
        "* More targeted responses (by refining question framing)\n",

This monitoring usually includes measurement of vital signs\\n(temperature, BP, pulse, and respiration rate), quantification of all fluid intake and output, and often daily\\nweight.

In a critical care unit, the following steps should be taken when managing sepsis:\\n\\n1. Early recognition: Recognize the signs and symptoms of sepsis early and initiate treatment as soon as possible. Suspect sepsis in any patient who has an infection and is showing signs of organ dysfunction, such as altered mental status, respiratory distress, or cardiovascular instability.\\n2. Resuscitation: Begin resuscitation efforts to maintain adequate tissue perfusion and oxygenation. This may include administering fluids, vasopressors, and oxygen.\\n3. Antibiotics: Administer broad-spectrum antibiotics as soon as possible, based on the patient's clinical presentation and suspected source of infection.\\n4. Source control: Identify and address any sources of infection, such as drainage of abscesses or debridement of necrotic tissue.\\n5. Hemodynamic support: Monitor and manage hemodynamic parameters closely, including blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygenation. Administer vasopressors as needed to maintain adequate blood pressure.\\n6. Renal replacement therapy: Consider initiating renal replacement therapy in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock who are not responding to fluid resuscitation.\\n7. Corticosteroids: Consider using corticosteroids in patients with sepsis who have refractory hypotension or evidence of adrenal insufficiency.\\n8. Coagulation support: Administer coagulation support, such as fresh frozen plasma or platelets, if the patient has significant coagulopathy.\\n9. Inotropic support: Consider using inotropic agents to improve cardiac output in patients with sepsis and cardiovascular instability.\\n10. Goal-directed therapy: Use goal-directed therapy, such as targeted temperature management or hemodynamic optimization, to optimize patient outcomes.\\n11. Multidisciplinary care: Involve multiple specialties, including critical care medicine, infectious disease, and surgery, in the care of sepsis patients to ensure comprehensive and coordinated care.\\n12. Continuous monitoring: Monitor patients closely for signs of organ dysfunction or worsening sepsis, and adjust treatment plans accordingly.\\n1\""
